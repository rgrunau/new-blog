I'm a frontend focused fullstack software engineer with a passion for design and solving excting and mundane problems.
I bring a unique end user persepective to my work. I have a diverse work background that includes long stints working
and most recently as a software engineer who has worked for gloabal brands and small startups.

This broad work experience has given me a wide perspective and an empatheic approach to working with teams and clients. I believe that great software is
built by great teams and great teams are built on trust, respect, and compassionete feedback.

I am always looking for ways to push my skills and grow as an engieer and a person. I am currently moving my skill set
to the back of the stack, and following a burgenoning interest in devops and cloud infrastructure.
