## About

I'm software engineer who has written frontend components and featrues
for small scrappy startups and done major data migrations for mulitnational
corporations. Though I started in the frontend of the stack, I've grown to
love writing backend code and I am currently working on projects in written
in Python and Go. Above all I love solving tricky problems.

I currently reside in Seattle, Washington with my wife and daughter. Who I annoy by picking on the mandolin every space moment I have. Out of work I being outside, camping, running, and playing bluegrass music.
