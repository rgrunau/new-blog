In his 2018 talk titled "Everything is hard again", designer Frank Chimero laments that his twenty-years of experience in building websites is really
just five years of experience repeated four times. I love this talk when I first encountered in 2019 becuase I was having a hard time wrapping my head
around the new web, but I didn't have Frank's twenty years of experience to fall back on. Five years later I've been thinking about this talk a lot,
but not because I am dumbfounded by the the constantly shifting sands of web development, but because I feel like I am starting my career over again.

In January, after nine months of looking for a new job I started a contract position with FedEx Dataworks. Not writing a react app, or anything remotely in the space I'd spent
the last three years learning, but doing a major data migration using a Powershell scripts, 3rd party tooling (of course), and python.
